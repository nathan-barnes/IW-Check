      <p class="description">Different buy options and purchase flow depending on whether the design is not paid for, half paid, or fully paid. Added new emails, PDFs, and modals.
Loading modal for Stripe purchases
Removed unnecessary transition object.
Remove API calls on already purchased designs (so price is not recalculated). Also remove stats on purchased designs.
Fix error where UNSAVED was being set to true instantly (thus always asking if a user really wants to redirect).
Add tag for purchases in the profile view.

All designs that are of type "design" are now manipulable by anyone, with the same intent as PR #186. 
If user is on a design page that they do not own and they press the buy button:
  If the user is logged in – the design is saved as a copy and buy process is started.
  If the user is not logged in and no changes were made – the buy process is started.
  If the user is not logged in and changes were made – the user is prompted to login/make an account. If they do so, the design is saved as a copy and then buy process is started.

          <p>Hey @twastvedt , can you look over the views "/invoices/paid-full-invoice.html.erb" and "/invoice_mailer/paid_full_invoice_email.html.erb" and "/invoice_mailer/paid_full_invoice_email.text.erb"? I drafted them, and they are very similar to their "paid_half" counterparts, but check them out and change what you like before we deploy.

We will also have to update the `is_paid_half` and `is_paid_full` columns of the purchases in the database. Just let me know if there are any that are theoretically paid in full, otherwise I'll set them all to `is_paid_half: true` tomorrow.</p>

          <p>@markjanzer As you say, very few changes. I think this looks good. I may take a pass through all of the communication later.

Sorry if I wasn't clear with my note on the issue with the list of emails ( #182 ). You're fine to set them all to `is_paid_half`. Thanks!</p>

          <p>Moe,

Ok. I like the UI approach. Internally, though, I'd like to find a more consistent way to represent this. What are the implications of adding a new Application (`none`?)? There would be a corresponding system (currently defined in the spreadsheet as `flatPanels`). This seems pretty straightforward to me, but maybe I'm missing something?


Did you test saving/loading a design? In my environment it looks like something is broken there. When I load a panels only design I get the context wall and shadow but no panels. The Panels Only disabling overlay also doesn't show. If I try to switch back to a hardware system then the context wall disappears and won't reappear.


Thanks,

          <p>Great. I like the way you've organized it now, as it's really a higher level distinction than wall/facade/etc. On further consideration, can we just call this application "flatPanels" behind the scenes, to open future doors to naming other "none" application types? Again, I like the UI as you have it now.


Thanks,

          <p>@twastvedt I fixed up the saving issue and added a variable to save the application type previously selected. 

I am having a small issue sending DESIGN.application type of "flatPanels", the price returns a `NaN` value. So for now that line https://github.com/dixonandmoe/imagewall/pull/185/files#diff-3c7a09a2fef2b4a2559e8a2bd6f132b8R103 is commented out.

But otherwise I think this is ready to go. Note on Friday I tried a more complicated integration going into the depths of the IW.settings and DesignModel, but it broke way too many things for something as simple as sending a new application type. That value does persist deep into the app so instead when a user toggles to Panels Only, I set the application type to wall, then run `setApplicationType` then set the application type to 'flatPanels'. 

Not sure if you want to build out a more robust solution but with my limited knowledge of the spreadsheet and system settings, I think this solution works for now.

          <p>Cool. I updated the spreadsheet so it should be ready now for "flatPanels". I would love to build out a more robust solution! Always! Sometime. If this works though, that works for me.

          <p>I couldn't stop myself, I went and made the robust solution. I think the above commits should fix everything. Sorry, I realize that this was more difficult after I went and made all those changes. I didn't actually make too many changes, just added a `case` to `design-scene:setApplicationType` and `design.model:updateSystem`.</p>

          <p>No that's great! I cringed a few times while reviewing the changes on github, so I'm happy you were able to clean it up fairly quickly.

I'll review it then we can merge it in.</p>

          <p>@twastvedt Everything looks good! The only thing I noticed was that you lowered the floor whenPanels Only is selected, just double checking if that was intentional.

If that's the case, I think this is ready to merge.</p>

          <p>@moeamaya The floor is lower than for walls, but the same as facades. Yes, intentional. Thanks for checking!</p>

          <p>@moeamaya I fixed the image export so that it's always aligned to the wall. I think it would be most logical for those images to always be the aspect ratio of the wall itself, so, no margins in the image. However, it looks like something is forcing the design images to always save, or at least display, in a 2:1 aspect ratio. Do you know where that happens, and how to change it? Or am I better off just accepting the 2:1?</p>

          <p>Pulled down your branch and I tried both using the Export Image and Saving a design and neither seemed to be generating an image for me. No errors in the console, but both Chrome and Firefox on Mac return a blank png image.

Note I'm also not sure about the 2:1, maybe @markjanzer knows why that is?</p>

          <p>@markjanzer @moeamaya Nevermind. I just didn't understand how imgix urls work. What a cool tool. I love the automatic cropping with edge detection. Anyways, I was able to get the correct aspect ratio by turning off cropping for those requests.</p>

Something strange is going on with purchased designs. Here's what I'm seeing:
1. Log in, create design, purchase/get invoice.
4. Everything can still be edited and saved over the original design. However if I go to my profile there are now two apparently identical designs, the one with the original ID and one with a new ID. If I click on the new one, I'm returned to the designer with an empty panel (no buttons, not even 'buy').

What of this is intended? A couple things seem strange to me, but let me know if I'm missing something:
1. If a new ID is created upon purchase, the url should change and the controls should be removed upon completion of the down-payment. I also think that the two identical designs in the profile is confusing - maybe the old one isn't preserved but the user is able to edit the purchased design and save as a new ID?
2. Shouldn't a buy button be displayed on the empty panel of a purchased design so that the user can make the second payment? Or, as suggested above, the full control panel is displayed but saving creates a new design.</p>

          <p>Hey Trygve, 
I agree that it's strange to see two identical designs on the profile page. We can put a tag on it to indicate that one of them is a purchase (and thus is not editable). 

We were originally conflicted with allowing someone to pay the second for the second half of an imagewall when we do not know if they have paid for the first half. For instance, the Stripe transaction could fail or the invoice could be unpaid and the system wouldn't know. Thinking about it more, the worst case scenario would be someone invoices themselves for both halves one after another without having paid either. I guess we won't concern ourselves with this and let them attempt to pay both halves immediately if they wish.

That being said, now we will allow the user to purchase the second half once they have purchased  the first (without our knowledge of whether the purchase actually went through), so we'll have the buy button appear on the purchase. The buy button will not appear on purchases where the user has already paid both halves. In addition, we'll add buttons in the modal for a successful purchase so a user can continue editing, or view the purchase (the uneditable copy of the imagewall). 

I'll start working on this today, and will hope to have it done next week. Also, once I push the changes up I'll need to find out which Designs are paid half and which are paid in full so we can edit their status in the database. Does this sound good to you?</p>

          <p>Mark,

This sounds great. Thanks for clarifying. I do remember the discussions about the purchasing logic, and I apologize that I hadn't investigated the full experience before now.


I think the workflow as you've outlined it sounds just fine. I have an alternative thought for part of it though. If you're already mostly through it, or the below is more complicated, don't worry about it.


I think we can assume that after purchasing a design, the user is done, for the time at least, with that design, so we don't need buttons in the modal to continue editing. I'd also guess that most of the time they don't need the editable version either. What if upon checkout the design becomes a 'purchase', rather than a new 'purchase' design being created? There could then be some explanatory text (which I can write) and a button in the mostly blank purchased design sidebar which would create an editable copy of a purchased design.


If this simplifies things, great. If not, I'd be curious to know why, but am just fine with the approach you laid out for now.


Thanks,

          <p>Hi Trygve,

No worries, I could have done more to clarify the complete purchase flow. 

There are a couple issues with turning Designs with a type of "design" into a Design with a type of "purchase."
We wanted to build out the purchasing system so it was possible for an architect to send an unalterable Imagewall design to a contractor (who is possibly not logged in) and have the contractor purchase that design. If designs were turned into the purchases (and thus made unalterable), we would have to change the system to only allow the owner of the Imagewall to purchase it. 

A less important reason is that we built out the purchasing flow with the (possibly false) assumption that the editable version could be used as means of continuing communication between Zahner and the customer. Zahner would have access to it through the "original_id" of the purchase to identify the original and the user would still have the original saved, so they would both have access to an editable copy. So if the user wanted to change specs after paying the first half or Zahner found that it needed to be different dimensions, the design could be used as a shared prototype.

However, if you want the user to be directed to the purchase page with an open success modal upon successful purchase rather than adding options for routing to the success modal, we can do that instead! I haven't built out those buttons on the success modal yet.

Thanks for the input! I hope to get this to you soon!</p>

Not sure if we also need to update price when reductions are added. For now it's commented out but we'll need to add it back in the controller and spreadsheet if it's needed.

Hiding the sliders when "None" is selected. But otherwise we display.

          <p>Awesome. Yes, 0-360 sounds good. The angle only affects the linear reduction though, right? And yes, this should trigger a price update, as the number of punched holes changes the fabrication time.</p>

          <p>Ok @twastvedt fixed up both the slider values setting and the correct order for Random and Linear. 

However, there's an interesting side effect of your refactored DesignModel I ran into. Seems like all the methods within the DesignModel are persisting to the database, this is directly out of database:

Not sure if this was the intention or not, but it did cause a bug where when I changed the `this.displayValueMap` the new values are overwritten by what's stored on that Design.

          <p>Ok @twastvedt I refactored the `initColorPicker` method with DesignApp to clean up a bunch of the redundancies. I think this is ready to merge, but I want to check with you if we should call updatePrice for the painted hardware or not worry about that at this time?</p>

          <p>@moeamaya Thanks for checking. Changing the hardware finish (raw, painted, anodized) require a price update, but changes to the color itself (within painted or anodized) don't. I'm thinking that amounts to a "yes" though, right?</p>

          <p>Ah crap there's 3 types for that?? I just thought painted lol. Aight I'll need a few more hours to add those options. But I suppose that will be a yes then. We'll have to work through this together @twastvedt then before we push it up.</p>

          <p>The PR is ready to check out @twastvedt. We also need to coordinate on the spreadsheet and DESIGN parameters in the Rails controller.

Also added a nice little feature when selecting a color where it shows on the material swatch now.

          <p>I like the color update!

It looks like nothing prevents someone from creating an anodized wall with a color that isn't an anodized option. If you select 'painted', then switch to 'anodized', and then don't select a color, you end up with the painted color, but the anodized finish selected.

Per my earlier comment, changing the hardware finish should trigger a price update. (Changing color within a finish doesn't need to, but it could and that wouldn't be a problem if it's easier that way.) I tried uncommenting the `getPrice` in `updateHardware`, but that didn't seem to do anything. Probably faster if you enable that?</p>

          <p>For the anodized wall, if they click that swatch should we default to the first color?

And for the price update, I'm leery of updating those controller methods mostly because I've broke the spreadsheet too many times to count now. I can call the method, but I prefer if you update the parameters that are sent back to your spreadsheet.</p>

          <p>Ok this one should be ready to go now. I made it so that anytime anodized is clicked, we update the wall or the hardware with only those limited options. </p>

          <p>Looking great. What were you thinking needs to change in the spreadsheet parameters? I removed the static value for `structureMaterial`. Anything else you had in mind? I don't need the color of the hardware for pricing, at least for now.</p>

      <p class="description">@moeamaya Realized there's already an object called `Design`. Whoops! Renamed mine to `DesignModel`. I didn't want to wade in any deeper, but should/could those be combined? It looked like `Design` had some controller stuff in it though, not sure.

Also what do you think of the promisifying of the initialization? This way it doesn't have to wait for all the images to load (I think?) and we can ensure that google.maps and the windMap are ready. Happy to discuss though.</p>

          <p>I already merged this yesterday, but yea let's keep the DesignApp and DesignModel separate for now. There's quite a bit of functionality in it and it's like you said it's acting as both a controller and the parent for all the rest of the app.</p>

      <p class="description">The need arose to be able to test the cost spreadsheet against a wide array of possible designs. This required creating sets of internally consistent design parameters, using all of the functions in design-option and design-option-system. Problem there was that in the current version each update to parameters is inextricably tied to an update in display and price. Felt like we needed a separate model, so, here it is. I ran into surprisingly few bugs, which I think is a sign that this was a good move.

NOTE: This pull request requires a change to the cost spreadsheet!</p>

      <p class="description">@markjanzer @moeamaya The price doesn't update when grid size is changed, and I think it's due to the removal of `getPrice()` from `design-option` in 71e8dbf. These changes look to me like they fix the issue without introducing duplicate calls, but you've both spent more time with getPrice() than I have. Thoughts? In general, is there a rule you'd like to follow for where calls to getPrice() are made? Always directly in the event handler? Or if multiple event handlers call the same function, like `setGridSize()`, should it be there once?</p>

          <p>@moeamaya Maybe should have had you review this. I took a stab at adding disabled styles to the environment buttons. Let me know what you think though, and if you have ideas for improvements, go for it.</p>

          <p>Hey Trygve,
I can't seem to recreate the error you showed. It's a pretty bizarre error, because the error that you see is good, it makes sense that the resource can't save because it's a duplicate. But then for it to log you in afterwards is very strange. That logic happens after the `if resource.save` logic that the code broke on. If you are able to get it to happen again on the live site, let me know the date and time as precise as possible so I can go into the logs to try to find out what happened.</p>

      <p class="description">@moeamaya I've tested this on a few devices here, and what I'm seeing is that an initial load of the design page doesn't load the webGL, but a refresh, or clicking on one of the presets, then brings up the 3d view just fine. Are you seeing this as well, or does it never work for you?

One thing I noticed when connected to chrome://inspect is that on the first load I'm getting the following error:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8107026/27699510-27867afe-5cc0-11e7-884e-271f21a4d700.png)
Refreshes don't appear to show the same error. Current theory: this error is stopping the javascript, causing the webGL to never even try to load. Any ideas why that error would show up on mobile and not desktop?

There's a separate issue with the shader that I'll look into.</p>

          <p>I don't know enough about how Rails loads javascript, but this is definitely a loading order issue. If I put `window.addEventListener('load', () => {` around the Stripe initialization at the end of `index.html.erb` (`var handler = StripeCheckout.configure({...`) then the error goes away, but is replaced by a similar one for ColorJoe. Looks like on mobile the script load order changes?</p>

          <p>We're loading the StripeCheckout code after we get the library from the remote location. It should load synchronously in order https://github.com/dixonandmoe/imagewall/blob/master/app/views/design/index.html.erb#L237. Not sure why it doesn't. 

To answer your other question, I'm not seeing any loading issues on my iPhone at all. Everything loads correctly, just had that shader issue.</p>

          <p>Man, favicons are more complicated than I thought. I thought I'd do this as I had already generated the images, but it took longer than I expected! Looks like there's a good bit of conflicting info out there. In particular, http://realfavicongenerator.net/faq recommends putting all the icons in the root (public) but Rails' `favicon_link_tag` is clearly set up to use images in assets. 

All that's to say, I'm not positive I did this right. Interested to know what you think.</p>

- [x] In general, buttons seem unresponsive. There's no animation or color change when clicking. Save is fine as there's the loading animation, but for everything else, if there's any delay it feels like something's not working.</p>

          <p>Hi Mark,
The toggles are pretty quick, so I think they're just fine. I'm thinking more about Buy, Calculate Tax, Request Invoice, maybe Upload Image.</p>

          <p>I added loading animations on the Calculate Tax and Request Invoice buttons. 

When a user hits the buy button, the user is waiting for the save to occur before the buy modal opens and this is shown as the save button has the loading state. When a user uploads an image, they should get the image on their imagewall almost instantly (but not the aws image), so the user shouldn't have to feel like they have to wait for the image to load before applying other changes.\

Let me know if you think this is alright. I can add the loading bar to the buy button as well as the save button when buy is hit, but I don't think it would look great (the loading animations would be moving at different speeds), and I don't think that it would add clarity to the user experience.</p>

          <p>@markjanzer Cool. Good point on the buy button, I think you're right. And you're right about the upload button too. I just find it strange that there is no visual change in these buttons when I hover or click. I'm so used to seeing this everywhere else that it makes the buttons feel inactive, even though something does happen when I click. I think after your changes this is more of a design decision than a usability issue.</p>

      <p class="description">@amdixon I've created an icon, and done a little research into the proper sizes and formats. I found this:
http://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_result?file_id=p1bjnh10d61cdik3puug1tnl1jqb6&technology=ror#.WVO9QlGVthE
which looks promising. Should I do that (install the gem, set up the favicon) or do you have a preferred method for this?</p>

          <p>We usually use a 64x64 PNG image and the default Rails helper for favicons. If you have the image I can drop it in, or if you prefer the method you mentioned thats fine too (although seems like a gem might be overkill for a favicon).</p>

          <p>@amdixon Good point, though I would like to include the other sizes and style info that realfavicongenerator puts out. Check out my new pull request, but feel free to change if I'm not doing it right, or if you'd do it differently.</p>

      <p class="description">What do you think of these? Several suggestions/comments from the team and others at Zahner.

**"Designs" -> "Create"**: "Designs" is a bit confusing - those who haven't used the app expect to find something like the gallery, whereas this is actually the call to action, what they're supposed to do. Maybe a verb conveys that better?

**Resources**: Looks like this is already in the mobile menu - any objections to adding it on desktop?</p>

          <p>@trygve adding resources to the main menu will break the menu at some smaller screen sizes (which if you're ok with then thats fine). For the designs --> create are you proposing to change just the name of the link in the menu bar, or changing the actual URL path (i.e. "/design" --> "/create") because the latter requires a bit more work. Also, changing "Wall" to "Feature Wall" may break the mobile styling.</p>

          <p>@amdixon Ok. Thanks for all the thoughts - much appreciated. 
- Resources: Hmm. Yeah, that's probably not great. What are the ramifications of changing `$screen-md-min` and `$screen-sm-max`? Looks like we'd need the breakpoint to go from 960 to 1050. The only common resolution that leaves out is 1024 wide, but Google Analytics is showing that over 98% of our desktop users are on screens wider than 1024.
- Create: Was just proposing a change to the wording, but maybe that's a bit strange. Changing it to just "Design" would get the verb and still match the url.
- Feature Wall: I tested resizing the browser window and it looks fine until it gets to 260 wide, which seems ok. Is there another test I should be performing though?

Thanks!</p>

          <p>@twastvedt the $screen-size variables control the breakpoints for the entire app, and I wouldn't recommend changing them. Changing "Designs" to "Design" should be ok. In addition to adjusting screen size you can also use Chrome's inspector to display common device resolutions (click the little icon in the top left of the inspector that looks like two overlapping screens). You can select iphone/android devices and make sure that the text will fit (we typically go to iPhone 5 scale ~320px)</p>

      <p class="description">Sorry this is so far reaching. I really do think it's most all connected though. A few extra things crept in - let me know if that's an issue and I can extract them (gitignore, set 'calculating' at page load, panel thickness stat). I just didn't merge until after those commits, fixed all the conflicts, and then realized they were in there. 

I'm not certain about some decisions here, particularly as regards which file to put the new methods in, and which methods should be triggering `getPrice()`. Let me know! 

Note this also includes the addition of logic to hit a development cost spreadsheet. When we eventually make this live, I'll need to update the production cost spreadsheet.</p>

          <p>Sounds good to me, at least for now. In reality, the background is typically darker as it's in shadow. (Though not always, if you have a shallow ImageWall on a white painted wall, for example.) One of the things further down my list is to figure out a way to represent that. On Shopfloor we allow the user to control the background color and have a disclaimer about how we don't know what their lighting conditions are. Not sure if that's the way to go, but I don't think we need to worry about it now (as I haven't brought it up at all in our discussions.)

          <p>That sounds fine. Set it up that way and then I can take a look and make sure the spreadsheet handles it properly.

          <p>@moeamaya I think that's fine. For now, we can just set a return depth of 0 and it will show a single surface. I'll experiment with lines between panels, or some other way to distinguish them.</p>

On FireFox it is working. I'm going to look into this more to try to find the cause, but for the moment could we try re-uploading Star Blue Copper's tileable image on the live site?

          <p>I think I had an incorrect image cached or something. The live site's Star Blue Copper didn't work even after you re-uploaded it, but after I cleared my cache it works fine. Interesting bug, but I guess it was just a problem for my computer.

          <p>We fixed part of the problem yesterday in #120 but this is still an issue, specifically with the perfMaterial rendered in the three.js and I think it could be better handled by Satoru. Could you pass some of this information on to him?

Currently, I believe that in our imageWallMesh.js file on line 99, the `loader` that we create with `THREE.TextureLoader()` makes a XMLHttpRequest with the `DESIGN.materialBitmap` that is passed in as texture. For some images this isn't working, and I believe it has something to do with the `crossOrigin`property of the TextureLoader. Dixon and I tried setting this without any success. Docs on it are here: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoade

Another quirk with this error, it only seems to be happening on the initial material load. For instance, the Dirty Penny demo isn't working on Dixon's machine at the moment, but if he goes to /design (with the Star Blue Copper material), and then selects the Dirty Penny material it works fine. 

This problem has something to do with the cached images, and that's also what makes this difficult to debug. If you are going to demo ImageWall and just want it to work, do command + shift + R on the designs with dysfunctional materials to clear the cache. If you are trying to fix the bug, do not do this. I cleared the caches on my browsers and now I'm having trouble recreating the issue on any browser.

To recreate the issue, click through the demos looking for the a javacript error and a black (not loaded) material texture, and try different browsers too.</p>

          <p>Cool! Let's do it then. Thanks!


Are you thinking the parameters side bar gets hidden in a menu or slide-out like the top bar does? A full screen 3d view would be pretty slick.

          <p>Hey Tryve I update the css and js code so that the designer is funtional on most mobile phones. We're seeing shader issues on iPhones and doesn't seem like the wall is rendering at all on Android. 

I'm going to close this issue as I believe these are issues with the 3D code.

          <p>Huh. 3D works on my phone, though there are issues with the shader. Do you have thoughts on how we could test this to get an idea of where it works and doesn't?

I'll look into the shader - looks like the issues we were having with resizing.

Is it impossible to rotate the view? Maybe mobile is a strong case for app mode.</p>

          <p>Oh crazy, what kind of phone do you have? I believe @robert-yuen has a pretty modern Android. 

Not sure about testing, beyond getting phones and testing on live devices. Chrome's device emulator was of little help even getting the styles correct.

Yea the code Saturo uses to orbit doesn't have the `touch` event enabled. I think appmode for phones would  be out of scope but a legit perfect feature for added services (pinch to zoom in particular).</p>

      <p class="description">I've had a couple comments that the project pages feel a little like a dead end. This is low priority (and debatable, if you feel strongly otherwise) because they aren't - you can click on Gallery in the top bar or the footer to get back to all the projects, but it does feel like maybe there should be some sort of return within the page itself. Maybe an "All Projects" button? Not sure.</p>

          <p>We were thinking that overall the modal doesn't seem like the best method for displaying the projects, and possibly going back to a more conventional page system (where the click takes you to the page). We already have pages for each project, if you open a project in a modal and refresh the page you'll be taken to the projects actual page. On that page we have a 'related projects' section and the designer CTA. Let me know your thoughts.</p>

          <p>Since the modal currently looks nearly identical to the page, I agree. The behavior is just confusing, as it's not clear that you're in a modal. However, the question is a little separate, as it pertains to the project page itself, not the modal. If we stick with the modals, I think a little spacing and maybe a bit more emphasis should make the "Close" link at the top obvious enough to provide a clear path back to the gallery.

When you click on "Start my design" on the Contact page, the designer doesn't load. This is because (I think), both pages use Google APIs, and they get loaded twice. There's an error in the console:

You have included the Google Maps API multiple times on this page. This may cause unexpected errors.

I'm not sure how to get it to only load the places API. (Contact loads some APIs, but not places.)</p>

- If I load the page with the javascript console open, image uploading never works.
- Without the console, image uploading usually works, but not always.
- I didn't see a difference between jpg and png formats.
- I'm also getting warnings in the console: `WARNING: 0:1: extension 'GL_ARB_gpu_shader5' is not supported` I'm not sure if this is related. I looked it up and it looks like it's a recent, known bug with three.js on Firefox and Safari. Firefox is working on a fix, Safari maybe is.</p>

          <p>Hey Trygve,

Could you zip the dxf files? It seems like it is common practice for downloadable dxf files to be zipped, probably for browser compatibility.

All of the dxf downloads work fine in Chrome, but in Firefox I can't seem to get it to prompt a download rather than show in a new tab as a text file. The only place I've seen online that prompted my FireFox browser to download as a raw dxf file was this one: http://www.signtorch.com/store/images/sample/Bighorn-Mountain-Goat.html?zenid=ln2e0e6dnrekm94c2jg0enf991

I'm not sure if this is due do the `=` at the end of the name (which we can't do due to url sanitization), or the fact that it's local (which we also can't do), or some other reason.</p>

          <p>Ah, interesting. Ok, done. Thanks for the research. I did a little Googling as well, and it looks like the ideal way to do this would be with a "download" attribute on the link, but that's not supported in IE<http://caniuse.com/#feat=download>. Curse you, IE.

All of the dxf downloads work fine in Chrome, but in Firefox I can't seem to get it to prompt a download rather than show in a new tab as a text file. The only place I've seen online that prompted my FireFox browser to download as a raw dxf file was this one: http://www.signtorch.com/store/images/sample/Bighorn-Mountain-Goat.html?zenid=ln2e0e6dnrekm94c2jg0enf991

I'm not sure if this is due do the = at the end of the name (which we can't do due to url sanitization), or the fact that it's local (which we also can't do), or some other reason.

      <p class="description">It feels odd to be able to name a design without signing in - there's no purpose, right? Perhaps naming would be another way to inform users on the benefits of signing in - "Please sign in so that you can keep track of your designs by name" or something similar.</p>

          <p>Hey Trygve,
Now that we have a notification when navigating away from an unsaved Imagewall, I think that this enhancement will have less utility. If you were to edit the name of a unsaved Imagewall when you are not logged in you would not be notified. Then if you were to try to navigate away you would be asked if you want to save before leaving, and if you were to hit save you would be prompted to log in. 

Let me know if the current solution works well enough!</p>

      <p class="description">(See #88 )
I noticed that overall width and height are being stored in the app in feet, but the spec, and the cost spreadsheet, are treating them as inches. I think I'd prefer to keep the cost spreadsheet in inches, to be consistent with every other distance value. Functionally it doesn't matter whether the app has this value in feet or inches, but might it make more sense to keep everything consistent? </p>

          <p>Yep. So I created a new, unprivileged user, and if I open a demo design, edit, and save, I overwrite the demo for everyone and reset the preview image. So, two things:

* ~~No one except admins should be able to edit demo designs (or no one but their creator, though then we need to transfer ownership occasionally).~~
* ~~As someone authorized to edit demo designs, resaving a new design shouldn't overwrite the preview image.~~</p>

          <p>Sorry, that's not actually correct. The design itself doesn't change, just the preview image. So for anyone, even those without admin access, saving a demo design as their own also changes the preview image for the demo design.</p>

          <p>This should fix the issue. This also makes it so the only way to change the image for a demo is by uploading a new image as an admin in /admin/designs/:token/edit. This prevents an admin from visiting /design/:token, tweaking a demo, and unintentionally changing the display image when hitting save.</p>

      <p class="description">Two special cases:
* Large walls (beyond $150,000), which usually have additional complications.
* International orders, where we can't calculate shipping and the level of structure currently isn't accurate (can't calculate wind loads).

Ideally we'd show an estimate - dollar range per square foot - in these cases. We also need to provide a way to get in touch to complete the order. Does the buy button transform into a contact button? Or is there always a contact button somewhere and the buy button is disabled? 

@moeamaya maybe this jives with the ellipsis for design duplication. Maybe we put Export Image in the ellipsis and replace it with an always-present "contact us" button?</p>

          <p>Yeah, do you think there's a usability issue there? It would certainly be easier to maintain, as I'm not the one deputized to make updates, so I just get a new pdf once in a while. I typically see T&C docs as pages not pdfs, but not sure what the reasons are.</p>

      <p class="description">The images used for the panel material texture are stored on the material inputs. These inputs do not show on Designs that the user cannot edit, thus the app can't find the materialBitmap and it breaks. 

Easy fix would be display none on the inputs. Theoretically someone could go into the console and do display: "" and get editability, but they could never save, or even buy it in that altered form.

Less efficient fix would be to send over the materialBitmaps for each material on each page load. We could send this over only when loading a page you can't edit and check for this on the rails side of things, and then again on the JS side. Kind of gross.

We don't want to store materialBitmap on the DESIGN should the materialBitmap for a material be changed by Zahner after a user applies the material, leaving the user with a old materialBitmap and inaccurate display. </p>

          <p>The view of a Design that the user does not own is now functional, but not pretty. 

There is a large amount of blank space where the design-menu functionality would be for an editable design. However when this space is removed, the boundaries of the 3d design app itself become apparent (usually the left edge is hidden behind the design menu). 

Not sure what the best solution is.</p>

This was my fault I broke it while CORSing all the things yesterday. Just pushed a fix for now. I'll create a new issue, but Mark and I will work on a new way to handle the image to ID reference in the App so this type of error doesn't happen again.</p>

          <p>We can calculate weight once we have open %. Open % is going to be a bit tricky though. I'll think about this, and talk to Satoru. Maybe leave those two off for now, and I can add them when I figure out open %?

Not sure how you want to go about including that. Can we do that just for browsers that need it? I'm also fine only including what's necessary for IE 11, especially if we can put up a note of non-support for older browsers. </p>

      <p class="description">Thought I'd make a shared list here. I know some of these are already on your list.

- [ ] Invert perf option (I'm pretty sure this is already on your list, but just don't want to loose it.)
- [ ] Scale figure (Again, pretty sure this is on the list, just want to make sure. Do you need a 3D file?)
- [ ] Wall and Screen do the same thing.
- [x] Loading a saved design fails silently. Refresh the page and the design loads just fine.
- [ ] Export image should really create a 2d image of the wall, not the current camera view. (Try it at shopfloorapp.com/imagewall/app.) Totally different beast, I know. I can think about this one as well.
- [ ] UI to select hardware material/color?
- [ ] Dropdown saved designs list.

          <p>Just checking, do the unchecked buttons look unformatted on your browser? Thought this might be a windows only thing.

          <p>One more - I fixed the minPerf issue in `fragmentShader.js`  (#33), but the string that is being used as the shader in the app still has the old version (I did a hard refresh). When I fixed the crashing bug it updated right away, not sure why it's not this time.

          <p>I merged the code but didn't push it up to heroku, until just now.

For Monday my plan was to finish the Wall and Screen structure geometry then focus entirely on making the app look nice. I think the rest of the features I'll push until after the Monday preview demo day.

For the scale figure, do you guys have something that works. I don't think anyone liked my naked guy lol: http://mockups.dixonandmoe.com/zahner/imagewall/7/

          <p>Ah, now it's working. Absolutely on pushing features/enhancements to after Monday. Just noting them here as I encounter them. I'll look into the figure. I think I want less detail and more androgynous. Thanks!</p>

- [x] Move System to the bottom as it's the most technical, least immediate.

          <p>Nope just forgot. Let me know when you have the sustainability and full stack images and I can hook them all up.

Also, on the design page it would be great if we can have a small, narrow image to pair up with the  included/excluded list (I just couldn't make it look good without adding an image, everything centered wasn't really working).</p>

          <p>Ok. I put images in Assets\Photos\About (safety, full stack, sustainability). The text for the people description and the mission is all in the doc - I didn't make a pull request because I'm not sure about the format for either:

- People description: Thoughts on how to format that? If not, it isn't absolutely essential, though it might be nice welcome text to the page.

- Mission: Do you have a style that would put the mission centered, without a photo? If not, or if you think it's best as-is, I don't have a great photo, but I can find one of one of our projects. 

I think we leave out the "Made in the USA" for now, as I'm not sure how to do that. If you have ideas though, go for it.

There's also a couple options in Assets\Photos\Design for included/excluded - I think the crop of Peterson (red) is best, but let me know what you think. </p>

          <p>Yup this one is definitely on my list and I have a good idea of how to fix this. Should be a linear equation that checks distance and +- the Z-value. Also need to check Z-val is negative to do the inverse</p>

          <p>I think the tile margin just needs to be bigger than the caption margin. Double sounds fine, but let me know what you think. Especially now that there are a lot of tiles, it feels a little tight.</p>

This one's from Tex, and I think worthwhile.

He noted that there's no confirmation when logging in, saving, or buying, so it's hard to tell if anything actually happened. This could be implemented in any number of different ways. Suggestions:

- Spinning wheel on the save button while saving, then button changes to "Saved" until you make another change.
- Popup confirmation/last screen on the buy flow.
- Welcome modal when logging in (least sure about this one, but I do see his point)</p>

          <p>Yes agreed on all fronts. There is a popup confirmation at the end of the buy flow it just wasn't working (should be fixed with our next push). Spinning wheel / save button is on our list.

For the welcome modal I will probably include an alert that pops up at the top of the screen with some text: "Logged in successfully, welcome back!" or similar.</p>
